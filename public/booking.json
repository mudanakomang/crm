The bathroom was mouldy and needed a good scrub! The pillows were horrible! We stayed 8nights here would not pay the money they charge to stay again. For a hotel that is only 2 years old its rooms and amenities need upgrading already! Don\u2019t waste your time using the laundry facilities they take forever and still leave clothes damp.

Highly recommend Rama Residence and the location is great."

The staff was extremely friendly and accommodating. Check in was very smooth and welcoming. The first night we stayed there was a happy hour on the rooftop for the sunset so we really enjoyed that. The pool and view are really nice. We enjoyed that a lot. The hotel location is excellent. Close to get to Kuta but also north to Seminyak. Easy to take tours around the island from this spot as well."
