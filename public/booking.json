Winaya (driver from resort) met us at the airport and after 15-20 min we rich resort.  Room was big and clean with big balcony where I was smoking. Big screen tv with at least 30 channels, news, sports, entertainment, movies. Location was in 3min walk to beach, you just cross the street and you are on the beach. Shopping mall another 3-5 min. Resort has a lot of different plants, trees, small statues, almost like you are in jungle. There was Italian restaurant where we had breakfast, big variety of food, pastries, fruit and juices and I love Balinese coffee, always had no less that 3. On this property there is pool, next to the restaurant and you can order drinks or something to eat from there. All staff was very friendly, helpful and alway smiles. \nWhen we arrived we received discount for massages in resort spa. That was excellent. We had several massages there during our stay. \nWe visited few temples, Bali Zoo, bird forest, few different beaches. In this property always was several cars with drivers and you can choose where you want to go and price. I would recommend Gede. ( pronunciation like GoodDay :))\nWhat else to say? Thanks to all staff for all you job, new general manager Mr. Harold, assistant Mr. Wayene, all other assistants, housekeeping, restaurant staff, masseuse, pools guys Wira and Made!!! That was amazing time and see you rather sooner than later :)))\nVladimir and Tatjana. Stayed in room 222 10 days and 111 3 days. January 2019"

When I woke up the first morning I found 4 alive cockroaches in the bathroom and 3 in the bed. I went immediately to reception and they told me they would send someone to clean. When I woke up the second day again 4 cockroaches in the bathroom and water leaking in the entire room. I called the reception and the attendant came. They said that they would fix the leaking and that unfortunately the cockroaches were due to a pest control they had done 2 days before. When I heard this I asked immediately to change room and they did, but without any apologies.\nThen we reserved the table for dinner for new year. At dinner our table was taken by another group and so they changed us another table which was not the one we booked. We also had prepaid 3000000 idr for the after dinner party which supposedly included all drinks we wanted up to 3000000.\nThe sad news is that when we reached the bar and asked for the first drink we found out that they had changes the menu list for the night and limited the drinks only to some cheap ones. We complained but nothing was done and therefore we had to basically drink what was on the menu.\nWe over paid also additional 600000 for extra drinks which supposedly were charged to our room.\nWe had two friends visiting our table and they were asked to pay an entrance fee even if they were with us!!! Ridiculous!!!!\nTwo days later at midnight someone knocks at my door to ask me to pay those 600000 because of a \u201ccomputer error\u201d they were not able to charge. I said that next morning I would have paid at the pool area but he insisted at midnight That I would be pay. Just because he was so insisting I did not pay and told him that I would pay next day!",

The housekeeping staff eventually arrived three hours later with filthy mops and rags to 'clean\" the room,  but they only made it look worse.  The water from the bathroom taps and shower had a very strong sulphur smell,  reflecting Bali's current water crisis and the recent volcanic activity.
