There is a nice balcony for the smokers..The restaurant and bar - Rosso Vivo front the hotel. French onion soup is really good as was gnoccho Gorgonzola and also the salmon. Live music, rock mostly, is 50 metres away..\r\nThe staff at the hotel are all very charming and many speak good English. Requests are performed quickly and efficiently. The Beauty/ massage/ pedicure etc salon is very good. Negatives include the hotel entrance and foyer which are less impressive and renovations being carried out. Lastly the price is very good in relation to nearby hotels. Happy holidays.",

            "content": "This hotel is in a great location opposite Kuta beach and in between Poppies 1 & 2. Thats was probably the best point about it. I had a seaview room on the top floor with a balcony  (great for relaxing and also drying clothes). Please note there is no elevator here so if you are less able this might be an issue, although i believe there are some cottages that dont have stairs. The hotel on site was nice and you could choose a table that sat street side which i enjoyed. I felt the breakfast was abit average and lacking in choice for 150,000 rupiah but maybe ive been spoilt from my last hotels. In terms of cleanliness i felt the room was tidy but not very clean. The shower walls had alot of marks on them, as did the balcony windows (mould) and there was a big build up of dust on the pretty wooden carvings. The towels had gone gray and some were threadbare. The cleaners really could put more attention into the job. I found the bed firm but comfortable and the room had good aircon with a fan as well. Every night there was a bar on Poppies 1 with a live band that was VERY loud and could be clearly heard until midnight when they finished. There is also construction going on at the hotel which disturbed my rest at times. \r\nAll the staff i spoke to were friendly and accommodating. Personally i do feel that the hotel is way too overpriced when compared to other properties in the area. If they could improve on the cleaning, amenities in the room and overall comfort it would be better. ",

Some construction was ongoing. I didn\u2019t find the staff overly attentive. And, the room was definitely below average for a 4-Star hotel. Some of the towels were tarnished and had small stains and lipstick marks. There were some small ants in the room here and there. I actually pulled out my phone upon check in to see if perhaps I got the information wrong and this was not the same hotel I booked. Or, maybe there weren\u2019t as many stars or good reviews as I remembered. I was surprised that this was the same hotel. I thought it may have been a 3-Star hotel or a different hotel. Again, it was not bad. I just expected more from a 4-Star hotel with good reviews. The staff seemed to always be occupied and not responsive or overly pleasant.
