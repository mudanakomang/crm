Sports bar attached to hotel can get busy and noise carries but not really late into night. The air conditioning was noisy and rooms are now looking bit tired and dull but still clean. So called garden view at rear end of hotel is non existent but hopefully will improve with renovations Location is excellent only a short walk from beach and plenty of bars, shops and restaurants.

Thank you for upgrading us to the executive deluxe room. Its so pretty and the bed is huge and fluffy. I had a good sleep every night and woke up late every morning!  Received a yummy chocolate cake in room after c/i and we enjoyed every single bite. At bkf, the hostess congratulated us again when we said our room number. They made us feel at home with their smile. Our flight was at 6pm and we asked for late c/o at 2pm upon c/i and they said ok. But on last day after breakfast i reconfirm the timing with the lady but she rejected me. So upset as we check in late on the first day and we wanted to do some last minute shopping and pack our bags. She keep on declining. After much negotiation, she only gave 1pm and wanted to charge us about $20 to c/o at 2pm. I was shocked as i have never encountered a hotel that will charge us to c/o at 2pm. I know that late c/o depends on the availability (i am a hotelier too) but i was granted upon c/i but upon reconfirming again, she said no. I told her to give us a little bit of time to pack our bags but she keep on repeating to quickly c/o. It was annoying as we have to pack our bags but she keep on calling you non stop. This wont happen if im given 2pm, as committed upon c/i. Ended the trip with disappointment. ",
