We were invited to a drinks reception at thd poolside on the Monday evening and this was a lovely touch encouraging guests to get to know each other. The breakfasts were lovely with a range of local, english and American style options. All the staff were friendly and helpful. The location was ideal, only a short walk from the beach and the area had a really laid back and chilled vibe.  We would definitely return. ",

All the staff were friendly and helpful, the hotel is kept fantastically clean and you can tell the staff take pride in there jobs, it had a great rooftop pool area.  We stayed in a studio room (310) room was great and comfy with plenty of space though the balcony is very small and being below the pool you can hear the water sloshing around when people are using it which isn\u2019t ideal though it didn\u2019t spoil our holiday and I\u2019d definitely stay here again, though I\u2019d pay a bit extra and go for a different room on a lower floor and a larger balcony. The hotel is good value for money with great staff and the breakfast is great. The local area is good with plenty of bars, restaurants, spa\u2019s and shops on the door step and the beach is a couple of minutes walk straight down the road",

We received an upgrade at checkin and had a very spacious 2 room suite which included a lounge area, kitchenette and a king size bedroom overlooking the beach. The hotel and rooms are modern and clean. The large bathroom was great and everything worked well which is unusual for Bali. Wifi was great and accessible throughout the hotel. Amazing infinity pool with a view of the beach and plenty of cabanas and chairs to relax in. A pool shower, toilets and a guest laundry is available along with food and drink delivery via a phone on the pool deck.  The Asian Spice restaurant downstairs served great food and an al-a-carte breakfast with a smile. Overall we loved this hotel and it will be our first choice when we return. If I had to picky and say anything negative it would be the storage space for clothing in the room but we were ok living out of the suitcase for the 7 days. Great hotel, location and staff.

Our mini suite was extremely comfortable and well maintained during our entire stay.\r\nI can\u2019t say enough about the customer focused service that we received from virtually every member of the RRP staff we met. Upon arrival we were warmly greeted by Indri and another staff member who guided us to the small but very personalized reception area. After a cold towel and a welcome drink, Teguh who checked us in, took us to our room and did a walk around highlighting some key features.\r\nThe highlight of our stay was the RRP staff. Every staff member, who are clearly well trained in delivering top notch customer service, treated us like royalty. The personal touch was evident in every interaction we had with any of them. No request was too big or small. We noted several instances where staff clearly went the extra mile. A special thanks to Kadek, Dana and Teguh for all their guidance and assistance during our stay.\r\nThe weekly cocktail parties on the terrace (which is great for viewing some amazing sunsets), provided an excellent opportunity to mingle with other hotel guests.\r\nA special thanks to Indri who with her ever smiling demeanour was always ready to provide helpful guidance. Thank you so much Indri. Finally, a big thanks to Richard for putting together such a wonderful team and keeping this operation running like clockwork.",

This hotel is ideally located close to the Legian beach BUT a little 'safe distance' from the younger crowds in the Kuta area.\r\n\r\nThe hotel is beautifully decorated and quite welcoming. The facilities are quite complete and well thought out. I love the idea of providing a washer/dryer. The gym is sufficient. The infinity pool...amazing!\r\n\r\nThe shining point of this hotel is the staff. We were greeted by the house manager Richard upon arrival. He was very helpful and accommodating and invited our family to a small gathering he was hosting to showcase the facilities and provide support & answer questions about tours, etc. Ms. Indri, the guest relations manager was also very welcoming and provided great suggestions on how to make the most of our trip. I appreciate how they both checked in regularly with the staff about their stay. \r\n\r\nThe front desk agents Ms. Kadek and Mr. Teguh were very kind and accommodating as well. \r\n\r\nThe food in the restaurant was exceptional. Mr. Richard bragged about how everything is made from scratch and there are no microwaves to be found in their kitchen and the taste definitely reflected the quality of the food. Mr. Eka was very helpful along with the many other waiters and waitresses. \r\n\r\nAgain, the Rama Residence Padma is a gem. Not only because of the good location and great facilities BUT mainly because of the teamwork amongst the staff to create a special and memorable experience for all of its guests.  \r\n",
